# Welcome to Dustin's Website!

### Who am I and why does this site exist?

I am a Software Engineer based in Bel Air, MD. With over a decade of experience in coding, I enjoy balancing architecture and code. I have a passion for lambdas, CloudFormation, serverless infrastructure as code, and utilizing services in AWS or other cloud platforms to create solutions. This site serves as a hub to link my GitHub, LinkedIn, and other social profiles and repositories to showcase my experience. For privacy reasons, I do not post my phone number or email address online, but you can reach me through the provided links.

### Info about the site

- [dustinhorning.info](https://dustinhorning.info) is a repository based on markup from [PHLY](https://github.com/phly).
- The markup offers many options, which you can find in older branches like `old-site`.
- The site is hosted on S3 and CloudFront on AWS, costing only $1.50 a month to maintain.
- The gravity toy is a fun feature; open it on a desktop to experience it.
- Clone the repo and run it locally. If you use PHP, like me, use Laravel Valet, and then add `/index.html` to view it in all its glory. There are many themes to choose from.
- You can also explore the PHP mail features! (which i do not use)

### Thank you for visiting!

I hope you enjoy exploring this site as much as I enjoyed creating it.
