# Welcome to the Dustin website!

### Who am i and why does this site exist?

<p>I am a Software Engineer based out of Bel Air, MD, I have been writing code for more than a decade and I really enjoy walking the fine line between aritecture and code. (e.g. Love lambdas, cloudformation, serverless infra as code, and utilitizing services in AWS or other could platform to come up with solutions.) Taking existing native features your server used to do, and offloading that CPU time to an external service, be it using AWS CLI or HTTP requests.<p>
<p>This site is just a place to link up my github, linked in and other such socials and repos to find my experiece. I do not want to post my phone number or email address on the internet for obvious reason, but i should be reachable at the links provided.

### Info about the site

- [dustinhorning.info](https://dustinhorning.info) is a repo based on markup from [PHLY](https://github.com/phly)
- This markup came with many options, you can find them in older branches like old-site.
- Also this is hosted on an S3 and cloudfront on AWS, and it costs $1.50 a month to maintain. Can't beat that!
- The gravity toy is a bit of fun. open on a desktop to experince it.
- Clone the repo and run it locally. If you are PHP-er like me, use laravel valet, and then just add /index.html to view it in all it's glory. There's many theme's to choose from.

### Thank you all for checking this page out. It's a fun little site and i quite enjoy playing with it.
